    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1: Search for music on the iTunes API\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function called `iTunesSearch` that accepts one argument---a search term and returns a list of results from the iTunes API. Your search should be limited to only include music tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.2: Get a list of songs\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that indefinitely asks the user for search terms (e.g., artist names, track names, etc.). For every search term the user enters, you should add the results from the iTunes API (part 1.1) to a list that tracks all the results. Your code should ask the user for search terms until they enter `'done'`. You should assign the list of results to a variable, which you will reference in part 2.\n",

    "## Part 2: Guess the song\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second part of this project, you will write code that implements a song-guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.1: Pick a random song\n",
    "After creating a list of songs (part 1), your code should pick a song at random from that list. You should use  [the `random.choice()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice) for this (be sure to import the `random` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.2: Play a song preview\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1), your code should play an audio preview of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you must import a few features from the `IPython.display` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from IPython.display import display, Audio, clear_output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After you do this, if you are given a URL for an audio file (suppose it is in the variable `audio_url`), you can play it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "display(Audio(audio_url, autoplay=True))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can try this with the audio url: `'https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Music7/v4/cd/a8/4c/cda84ca4-3ef1-d2b5-6f88-3640e5db33fc/mzaf_1355556193908011287.plus.aac.p.m4a'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.3: Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song:\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1) and playing a song preview (2.2), your code should\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace every **alphanumeric** character (meaning a-z, 0-9) in the track name with an underscore (`'_'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a song titled `\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"` should print out: `\"(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n",
    "(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a character is alphanumeric with the `.isalnum()` method: `'a'.isalnum()` is `True`. `'#'.isalnum()` is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.4: Allow the user to guess the track name (or pass)\n",
    "After your code picks a random song (2.1), plays the song preview (2.2), and prints a \"blanked out\" version of the song (2.3), your code should repeatedly ask the user to guess the song. Every time, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter a guess (using `input()`)\n",
    "- If the user guessed the correct track name, print `\"You got it!\"`.\n",
    "- If the user guessed incorrectly, print `\"It's not '<what the user entered>'\"`\n",
    "- If the user enters `'pass'` then your code should display the correct answer (`\"The song was '<track name>'\"`) and stop asking for guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part should **not** be case sensitive; if the correct answer is `'Thriller'` and the user guesses `'THRILLER'`, this should count as being correct. You can use Python strings' [`.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.5: Indefinite rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your code should repeat parts 2.1--2.4 indefinitely (until the user types `'exit'`). Note that this means you will need to have nested `while` loops (one for 2.4 and one for this part). One way to achieve this would be to put the code for part 2.4 into a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every round, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print `'== ROUND <#> =='`, replacing `<#>` with the round number (`1`,`2`,`3`,...)\n",
    "2. Pick a random song (as implemented for 2.1)\n",
    "3. Play a preview of the song (as implemented for 2.2)\n",
    "4. Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song (as ipmlemented for 2.3)\n",
    "5. Allow the user to guess the song with an indefinite number of chances (as implemented for 2.4), with the following modification:\n",
    "    - If the user types `'exit'`, your code should display the correct answer, wait 3 seconds, and clear the output (see \\#6 for how to do this)\n",
    "    - The user should still be able to enter `'skip'` to skip to the next round. The difference between `'pass'` and `'exit'` is that `'pass'` should move on to the next round. `'exit'` should exit the guessing game entirely.\n",
    "6. After the user guesses correctly (or passes), your code should:\n",
    "    - Display the correct track name (if the user passed)\n",
    "    - Wait 3 seconds (you can do this by importing [the `time` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) and calling `time.sleep(3)`\n",
    "    - Call `clear_output()` (imported from `IPython.display` earlier) to clean up the output.\n",
    "7. Increment the round and start up again at step 1"

If they do not type in a 'y' or 'n', they will be prompted to type in either of the letters until they actually do so.  If a user types 'y', they will have the option to choose an album cover hint or a release date hint and it will be displayed to them if they choose 'a' or 'r'. If they do not choose either, they will be prompted with the hint choice until they type in the correct response.  If they choose 'N', then the game will continue.

    "Addition 2: I used a combination of different elements for this addition. First, I imported a new time function called 'perf_counter' to track how long a user takes to guess a song, and I let them know after each round that they guess a song.  Also, I created and sorted a dictionary to let the user know which song they answered the fastest at the end and in how many seconds. Next, I kept track of the amount of rounds a user played in an overall game and displayed their current round to them during each new round, in addition to also keeping count of the number of skips they used. Then, after they exit the game, I created a game summary to display for the user how many rounds they played out of the total rounds gone through and have also displayed how many rounds out of the total rounds they chose to skip. Also, I created a point system that is based on the time it takes for a user to guess the song. They are able to see how many points they earned after each round, and at the end they can see the total amount of points they earned.  Overall, this addition ties in the amount of rounds and skips a player goes through, in addition to the amount of time it takes them to complete each round (if it was not skipped) and factors this data into a point system, and with this the total points earned is presented to the user at the end."
